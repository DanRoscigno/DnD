I rolled:
STR 8
INT 11
WIS 8
DEX 16
CON 13
CHA 10

I reduced INT by 2 and added 1 to WIS as this is my prime requisite.

Low strenght gives me a -1 on melee
High dexterity gives me a +2 on missile, +2 on AC, and +1 on initiative.
Decent charisma gives me max of 4 retainers, and retainer loyalty of 7

As a Druid I give the entire part a 5/6 chance of not getting lost,
and I personally have +2 against lightning or fire damage.

I chose dagger, spear, and sling as my weapons as they can all be used
as missile weapons.  The spear can also be used as a brace weapon and
that gives me double damage against charging monsters if I brace the
end against the ground.

I can use wood shields, and leather armor asI am a Druid

At level 2 I get two level 1 spell slots per day

My AC is 7 with leather armor, and my dexterity gives me a +5, so I
have an AC of 5 with my leather, and 4 with both leather and shield.

My hit dice is a D6, and I am level 2.  I get a +1 on hit dice
because of my onstitution.  So, my dice rolls of 5 and 3 with +1 on
each level give me 10 hit points.
