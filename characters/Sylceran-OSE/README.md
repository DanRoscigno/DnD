Creating Sylceran, a level 2 Druid
==================================

Ability scores rolled
---------------------

I re-rolled two of the scores that had two ones in each of them.
 - STR 8
 - INT 11
 - WIS 8
 - DEX 16
 - CON 13
 - CHA 10

Prime requisite
---------------------

The Druid has a prime requisite of Wisdom.  I increased it one by decreasing Intelligence by two so that I could avoid the XP penalty of having a low Wisdom.

Skills and abilities
---------------------

 - Low strength gives me a -1 on melee
 - High dexterity gives me:
    - +2 on missile 
    - +2 on AC 
    - +1 on initiative
 - Decent charisma gives me:
    - max of 4 retainers
    - retainer loyalty of 7

 - As a Druid I give the entire part a 5/6 chance of not getting lost.
 - I personally have +2 against lightning or fire damage.

Weapons and armor
---------------------

I chose dagger, spear, and sling as my weapons as they can all be used
as missile weapons.  The spear can also be used as a brace weapon and
that gives me double damage against charging monsters if I brace the
end against the ground.

I can use wood shields and leather armor as I am a Druid.

Spells
---------------------
At level 2 I get two level 1 spell slots per day.  The spells that I can use are:

 - Animal friendship 
 - Detect danger
 - Entangle
 - Faerie fire
 - Invis. to animals
 - Locate plant or animal
 - Predict weather
 - Speak with animals

Armor class
---------------------
My AC is 7 with leather armor, and my dexterity gives me a +2, so I
have an AC of 5 with my leather, and 4 with both leather and shield.

Hit points
---------------------
My hit dice is a D6, and I am level 2.  I get a +1 on hit dice
because of my constitution.  So, my dice rolls of 5 and 3 with +1 on
each level give me 10 hit points.
